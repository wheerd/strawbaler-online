# Strawbaler Logo

The Strawbaler logo is a technical SVG illustration showing strawbale construction with individual bales, wood framing, and roof structure - inspired by real strawbale building photos.

## Design Elements

### Visual Components:

- **Individual Strawbales**: Multiple golden straw bales (#daa520) arranged in offset pattern
- **Wood Frame Structure**: Vertical posts and horizontal beams in `woodSupport` color (#cd853f)
- **Roof Structure**: Peaked timber roof frame showing construction details
- **Foundation**: Solid timber base/sill plate
- **Straw Texture**: Individual straw lines on each bale for authentic appearance

### Logo Variations:

- **Compact**: Icon-only version for toolbar use (28px height)
- **Full**: Icon + "Strawbaler Construction Planning" text (32px height)

### Usage:

```tsx
import { Logo } from '@/components/Logo'

// Full logo with text (default)
<Logo />

// Compact version for toolbar
<Logo compact />
```

## Technical Accuracy

The logo represents authentic strawbale construction:

- **Post & Beam Frame**: Timber structure carries structural loads
- **Infill Bales**: Individual straw bales provide insulation between posts
- **Offset Pattern**: Staggered bale layout like traditional masonry
- **Roof Integration**: Shows how timber frame supports roof loads
- **Foundation Detail**: Sill plate elevates bales above ground moisture

This design mirrors real strawbale construction techniques and reinforces the application's focus on professional building planning.
